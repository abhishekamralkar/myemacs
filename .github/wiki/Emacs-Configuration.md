# Emacs Configuration

## Overview
This page documents the configuration and customization of your Emacs setup located in the `.emacs.d` directory. The configuration is designed to enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and provide a personalized editing experience.

## Directory Structure
Below is an example structure of the `.emacs.d` directory:

```
.emacs.d/
├── init.el               # Main configuration file
├── custom.el             # Custom settings generated by Emacs
├── lisp/                 # Directory for custom Lisp scripts
├── themes/               # Directory for custom themes
├── .github/              # GitHub workflows and wiki files
└── README.md             # Documentation for the configuration
```

## Key Features
1. **Package Management**
   - Uses `use-package` for managing and configuring packages.
   - Automatically installs missing packages on startup.

2. **Custom Keybindings**
   - Custom keybindings are defined to improve navigation and editing efficiency.

3. **Theme and Appearance**
   - Includes custom themes for a visually appealing interface.
   - Configures font size, line spacing, and other UI elements.

4. **Programming Support**
   - Syntax highlighting, linting, and autocompletion for multiple programming languages.
   - Integration with Git for version control.

5. **Org Mode**
   - Enhanced support for `org-mode` for task management and note-taking.
   - Custom templates and shortcuts for faster workflow.

## Example Configuration
Here is a snippet from the `init.el` file:

```elisp
;; filepath: /home/abhishekamralkar/.emacs.d/init.el
;; Initialize package sources
(require 'package)
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
(package-initialize)

;; Install use-package if not already installed
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(require 'use-package)
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)

;; Example: Configure ivy for better completion
(use-package ivy
  :diminish
  :bind (("C-s" . swiper))
  :config
  (ivy-mode 1))
```

## Customization
- **Themes**: Place your custom themes in the `themes/` directory and load them in `init.el`.
- **Lisp Scripts**: Add your custom scripts to the `lisp/` directory and load them dynamically.

## Notes
- Ensure you back up your `.emacs.d` directory regularly.
- Keep your `init.el` modular by splitting configurations into separate files if it grows too large.
