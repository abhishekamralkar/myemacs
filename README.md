- **Custom Keybindings**: Includes custom keybindings for faster navigation and editing.
- **Programming Support**: Syntax highlighting, linting, autocompletion, and language server integration for multiple programming languages.
- **Org Mode Enhancements**: Improved support for `org-mode` with custom templates, bullets, and settings.
- **Modern UI**: Features a clean and modern UI with `doom-modeline`, `dashboard`, and custom themes.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Includes `gcmh` for optimized garbage collection and other tweaks for a smoother experience.

OrgEmacs provides configurations for the following programming languages:

- **Python**: Integrated with `lsp-pyright`, `blacken`, and `pyvenv` for virtual environments and formatting.
- **Golang**: Configured with `go-mode` and `gopls` for Go development.
- **Rust**: Includes `rust-mode` and `cargo` for Rust development.
- **Clojure**: Configured with `clojure-mode`, `cider`, and `clj-refactor`.
- **Bash**: Enhanced with `company-shell` and `flycheck` for shell scripting.
- **Emacs Lisp**: Includes `slime` and `slime-company` for Lisp development.

## Installation

To set up this Emacs configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Install Emacs**  
   Ensure you have Emacs installed on your system. You can download it from [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or use your system's package manager.

2. **Install Git**  
   Ensure `git` is installed on your system. Use your system's package manager to install it if necessary.

3. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository into your `.emacs.d` directory:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:abhishekamralkar/myemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   ```

4. **Run the Installation Script**  
   Navigate to the cloned directory and execute the `install.sh` script to automate the setup process:

   ```sh
   cd ~/.emacs.d
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

5. **Start Emacs**  
   Open Emacs, and it will automatically install the required packages using `straight.el`.

6. **Verify Configuration**  
   Check if all packages are installed and working correctly. Use `M-x config-edit` to edit the configuration if needed.

## Key Features

### Package Management

This configuration uses `straight.el` for package management. It ensures reproducibility and allows for easy customization of packages.

```emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
```
